# react-runner-buble

[react-runner](https://nihgwu.github.io/react-runner/) but use [buble](https://github.com/bublejs/buble) as the compiler, which has better support for old browsers(like IE), but some wonderful features like `class fields` are not supported, also type system is not supported, so the `type` parameter in the API is not available.

If you want to use it with [react-live-runner](https://github.com/nihgwu/react-runner#react-live-runner), just alias `react-runner-buble` to `react-runner`, then `react-live-runner` could be used to replace `react-live` without fear.
